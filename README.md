# k-means-img-clustering
Given an image in ppm format, find the main color clusters. Then, output a new image with only having the main clusters.

# Getting Started
The main file is run_k_means. This will ask to input the name/directory of the image file (make sure it is in ppm format), Afterwards it will ask to input the number of cluster (k), and output a new image with only k colors.
